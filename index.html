      <p>A-woof, woof! *sniff* Oh, I mean, nice to meet you!</p>
      <p>My name is Waffles, and I'm a stuffed dog adopted by my mommy, Yi. I love being petted and playing with humans. I'm barely one year old, but I'm paw-sitive we'll get along. Click around my website to learn more about me!</p>

There are so many perfect spots to admire the scenery and the main Manhattan island from afar... without all the scary noise of cars and people! If you keep going south, there's a rescue shelter with lots of other animal friends! I wish Yi would go there more often so I could play with them. Maybe one day, we'll even rescue a cat from them!</p></div>
